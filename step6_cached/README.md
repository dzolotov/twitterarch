# Step 6: Cached Architecture with Circular Buffers

Advanced implementation with Redis caching and circular buffer for feeds.

## Features
- Redis cache for hot feeds
- Circular buffer implementation for feed storage
- Message caching to reduce DB hits
- Head/tail pointers for efficient updates
- Cache warming strategies

## Architecture Components

### Circular Buffer Feed Cache
- Fixed-size feed per user (e.g., 1000 tweets)
- Head pointer: newest tweet position
- Tail pointer: oldest tweet position
- O(1) insertion and deletion

### Caching Layers
1. **Feed Cache**: Hot feeds in Redis with circular buffer
2. **Tweet Cache**: Popular tweets cached
3. **Message Cache**: Recent messages to avoid re-processing

## Implementation Details

```
Circular Buffer Structure:
[T5][T6][T7][T8][T1][T2][T3][T4]
           ^head      ^tail

After adding T9:
[T5][T6][T7][T8][T9][T2][T3][T4]
                 ^head ^tail
```

## Running the Demo

A demo script is provided that creates a realistic test scenario:

```bash
# Run the demo script
./run_demo.sh
```

The demo creates:
- 2000 regular users
- 1 superstar user (ID: 2001) with 1999 followers
- Demonstrates Redis caching benefits
- Shows circular buffer efficiency

## Performance Testing

The demo script tests the cached architecture:
- Superstar user with 1999 followers
- Cache warming for hot feeds
- Circular buffer operations
- Cache hit rates and performance metrics

## Performance Improvements
- 10x faster feed reads for hot users
- Reduced database load by 80%
- Handles celebrity users with millions of followers
- Automatic cache invalidation
